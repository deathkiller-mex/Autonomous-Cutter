Homeowners struggle to maintain and upkeep their front and back yard landscaping. Depending on the location, tall grass, weeds, or dirt can become overwhelming.  Maintaining a clean and presentable yard is essential for both aesthetic appeal and safety. According to Tom Bradford, an Assistive Technology Specialist & Senior Mobility Consultant, the demand for yard work assistance is high among those 75 or older. 

Tall grass and weeds are a significant and persistent problem for homeowners and businesses, as they can grow almost anywhere, regardless of whether pesticides are used to control them or even if concrete is applied. They will eventually grow through the smallest cracks. This prevalence is a problem, as elderly or disabled people are unable or it is risky for them to give proper care to their garden. Additionally, this is also a problem for individuals and businesses, as removing them is costly, both in terms of time and money.

Older adults often want to remain in their homes and communities as they age, a preference, this is known as “aging in place.” However, Ratnayake explains that maintaining a home and yard can become a major challenge for these individuals. Declining physical ability makes tasks such as mowing, trimming, and weed removal increasingly difficult. At the same time, limited financial resources only add more problems, since many elderly people live on fixed incomes that cannot easily afford outside help. This combination of physical and financial barriers often results in neglected yards, which can lead to further problems like safety hazards. Aging in place depends not only on the structure of the home but also on the surrounding environment, including the yard and landscaping. When yards become unsafe or unmanageable, elderly people feel pressured to move to nursing homes, even if they prefer to stay at home. This makes yard maintenance a critical factor in the independence of older populations. 
Neglected yards and overgrown gardens create hazards besides only aesthetics. Unmaintained grass and weeds can become a breeding ground for pests such as rodents, snakes, and insects. These pests not only threaten to damage the property, but they also put human health in danger. Overgrowth can also increase the risk of fires, especially in dry climates where tall grass can ignite quickly if given the opportunity. Structural damage is another consequence, as roots and invasive plants may block sidewalks or fences. In addition, thick vegetation can make outdoor spaces unsafe to walk through, increasing the risk of tripping and falling. Poorly maintained yards also negatively affect neighborhoods by reducing the value of the properties. Besides the homeowners, businesses also suffer, since a neglected exterior can decrease the number of customers and damage the business's reputation. 

Another major problem with yard maintenance is the widespread use of pesticides and herbicides. According to Environmental Health and Engineering, many of the most common lawn-care chemicals are linked to serious health risks, including cancer, reproductive harm, and neurological issues. For example, 2,4-D and glyphosate, which are widely used to control weeds, have both been associated with long-term health concerns. The problem also affects homeowners who use these chemicals directly, since pesticide residue can expose neighbors, children, and pets. This makes yard maintenance not just a private concern but a public health issue. In addition, chemicals from lawns can pollute soil and water sources, harming local ecosystems and wildlife. This highlights the environmental costs of what might happen if these pesticides are used as routine yard care. Although chemical solutions may appear cheap and effective in the short term, they often create larger, hidden costs like health risks and environmental damage. 

Grass and weed growth have always been a persistent challenge, but their impact is much more important than what I see at first. For elderly and disabled people, maintaining a yard can be both physically and financially dangerous, which threatens their ability to keep their independence and age in their own home. At the same time, overgrown yards create safety hazards by attracting pests, creating tripping risks, and even being a fire hazard. Businesses and the whole communities are also affected, as neglected exteriors can lower the property's value. Many people turn to pesticides as a quick solution, yet these chemicals introduce new problems by putting people’s health in danger and harming the environment. This leaves homeowners and businesses struggling with either high financial expenses or dangerous consequences. Current solutions are not accessible for everyone, especially those with limited income or mobility. Therefore, there is a clear need for affordable, safe, and sustainable alternatives for yard maintenance.

# Building

This project consists of an affordable autonomous weed/grass cutter. It will be controlled/limited by IR sensors as well as ultrasonic sensors to designate a specific cutting area, as well as to detect obstacles. Everything will be 3D printed except for, obviously, the electronic components and wheel rod. Gears will be 3D printed too, but may be made out of metal on a future if they are not durable or reliable. I recommend using at least PETG or something with more structural strength, as well as heat and cold resistance, as the robot will be outside. For the blades, I will start trying out how metal strings work instead of the common plastic ones, but if they prove unsafe, unreliable, etc. i will change them to plastic
